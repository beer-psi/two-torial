Please treat each controller's section as its own individual list of noteworthy elements.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#iidx","title":"IIDX","text":""},{"location":"extras/ascs/#dj-dao-fp7-emp","title":"DJ DAO FP7 EMP","text":"<p>This controller works really well, the spacing is accurate to the arcade between buttons and the turntable, obviously the turntable size is reduced which is often noticed as a minor nuisance to players that play both at home and on cabs.</p> <p>One minor aspect that's appreciated are the feet of the controller, which hold up really well on all kinds of surfaces with a stable grip, alongside the fairly hefty weight of the controller it's rather unlikely it's going to budge even a little bit during play.</p> <p>This controller is not without fault though, one of the first things to go is the turntable sticker in the middle, it starts to peel pretty much instantly for several people. While some people have kept it on despite the peeling, some have ended up scratching their pinky fairly significantly on it, so it's worth considering its removal or finding a better adhesive.</p> <p>The rubberized turntable grip itself is also susceptible to peeling, but it's far more reliable, perhaps miscare or improper installations from Dao lead to problems sooner, but for many it will last several years without a problem.</p> <p>Another concern is in only in having a <code>START</code> and <code>EFFECT</code> at the top of the controller. IIDX utilizes 3 buttons in menu navigation, namely <code>START</code>, <code>EFFECT</code>, and <code>VEFX</code> so the limited option is a bit troublesome. However, the solution to this problem DJ DAO utilizes is the ability for the <code>EFFECT</code> button to take multiple inputs as separate bindings. To simplify this further, enabling this option allows single, double, and triple taps of the <code>EFFECT</code> button in rapid succession to be 3 different bindings, alleviating the need for another button.</p> <p>Unfortunately though, this does add latency to the button, it also doesn't feel too natural, and many owners use more responsive custom firmware over DJ DAO's firmware that, at the time of writing, doesn't support this multiselect feature anyways, meaning the problem is still present. Many users choose to upgrade from the default USB board to a custom one (Arduino, Arcin) since the button lights can't be controlled via software and it's only polling at the default 250hz. Of course that also means you can't use the original board's PS2 connector anymore.</p> <p>One thing to note with the rubberized turntable grip, this controller gets gross. Dead skin will build up around the edges of the turntable itself on the metal and along the edges of the rubber grip. Regular cleaning is required.</p> <p>All in all, this controller has a few minor problems but is often regarded as the best balance between price and performance, as it matches arcade play at a great price.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#phoenixwan","title":"PHOENIXWAN","text":"<p>The Phoenixwan, sometimes jokingly referred to as the wang, or phoenixwang, is a rather odd controller. It fills a niche that wasn't needed (Gamo2's site was already selling 6 different IIDX controllers) but still manages to be the smallest full-sized beatmania controller offered on the site.</p> <p>As expected, the spacing between the buttons and turntable is arcade accurate, and the turntable is full sized unlike the FP7. Moreover, 4 buttons are present for menu navigation this time around. </p> <p>The controller is also very flashy, with a customizable turntable LED that emits 16 million different colors, turntable sensitivity adjustment, and an audio light mode that tries its best to \"dance with the music\" in fanciful fashion, it's a neat gimmick. Lastly for maximum portability, this controller is very light and even features wire storage at the bottom.</p> <p>However, with the flashy style this controller brings it unfortunately takes a few steps backwards in other areas. One of the most perplexing areas are the feet, there's no other way to put it, some surfaces it's great and some it sucks. With the reduced weight, this controller will slide across some surfaces with ease leading to a really unpleasant experience. It would not be surprising if with improper play that the controller could be moved very easily by accident.</p> <p>Onto one of the more defining features though, the turntable grip. Gamo2's site says it's made of liquid silicone and space aluminum. The grip is fantastic, it's incredibly grippy and a lot of fun to stop on a dime back and forth on your hand. But this material doesn't come without some faults unfortunately, it gets turned into a fingerprint magnet right out of the box, and some users have reported the grip wears off and becomes flat after heavy usage. One could also argue that making a controller trying to replicate an arcade experience (hence arcade-style) that it's a bit backwards to deviate away from the arcade experience as well, but that's more semantics than anything.</p> <p>Lastly and most critically, a fair batch of buyers reported PCB problems where the board seemed to flat out die after just a few months. Apparently a firmware update can be pushed to work around some issues, but there's not much that's definitive as a solution in regards to this issue at the time of writing. </p> <p>Overall, the Phoenixwan is probably the best option in terms of portability and style, it's a very flashy device and great to take over to a friend's for some fun. But, with it comes a heftier price tag that might not be worth it for people looking to simply enjoy the game. With some critical issues, this controller might just be style over substance.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#yuancon-iidx","title":"YuanCon IIDX","text":"<p>YuanCon's IIDX controller looks rather plain, doesn't it? But the controller works really well, the spacing is of course accurate to arcade, and the turntable is full size as well. Obviously, it features 4 buttons for menu navigation too, which is incredibly convenient.</p> <p>The cost is very reasonable too, by default it comes with dubious microswitches labeled \"Chinese\" on the site, it's important to note that if a buyer upgrades to Omron switches on the site, it's a bit cheaper than buying Omrons separately later down the line. The \"Chinese\" switches are definitely not recommended and feel bad.</p> <p>This controller oddly uses an acrylic turntable as well, while it's a nice attempt it's somewhat disappointing overall. At the very least, it's fairly easy to modify the turntable and place something more proper such as an EMP mat on it for a better experience. Just note that the screws are not countersunk around the center of the turntable.</p> <p>Some people may be dissatisfied that the turntable has no lights too, an obvious cost cutting decision.</p> <p>The default buttons are typical cheap Chinese ones, these risk occasionally getting stuck around the enclosure's corners but it's less common than Chinese buttons for use on other games such as Pop'n and some users don't end up with any problems at all. Depending on a buyer's level of tolerance they may find these buttons fine or desperately yearn for an upgrade.</p> <p>One big positive for many is the detachable USB cable, it uses just one USB port which is quite handy. This comes at some costs though. The biggest issue is the lack of PS2 support, the lights are also dimmer than Dao's offerings which utilize 2 USB ports.</p> <p>Yuan's IIDX attempt is solid, but it's not without fault. Regardless, just about any buyer would be more than satisfied playing and enjoying the game on this controller regardless of the few minor faults it has.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#iidx-arcade-parts-to-consider","title":"IIDX Arcade Parts to Consider","text":"<p>IIDX controllers have a lot of options to choose from and it can be daunting, especially if you've never played before. I'll try to cover springs, microswitches, and buttons to the best of my ability. </p> <p>I've also documented many of the parts that I talk about and where to buy them here</p> <ul> <li> <p>Buttons/Keys</p> <p>The most commonly used buttons are Sanwa, Gersung, and DJ DAO/Yuan Chinese buttons. </p> <p>I can't really speak for every arcade in Japan, but both in Japan and US almost all arcades use Sanwa buttons. The Samduck buttons are a Korean variant that can be found in Korean arcades, but are still superceded by Sanwa buttons. The DJ Dao/Yuancon buttons are cheap Chinese clones that feel less satisfying both in physical feedback and audio feedback. Some players find them servicable, but I ultimately recommend upgrading when possible. The travel distance is different on Dao buttons for example due to the inaccurate construction having a different height than official parts like Sanwa, so the feeling will be significantly different in using them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Microswitches and Springs</p> <p>If you buy the keys sepearately it's worth noting what spring and microswitch setups they come with:</p> <ul> <li>Sanwa keys come with 100g springs and 100g Omron switches.</li> <li>Samduck keys come with 20g springs and 65g Gersung switches.</li> <li>DJ DAO keys come with 40g springs and 20g Honeywell switches.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>There are also many other cheap Chinese variants that I won't bother listing because I insist you do not play on them. Please stick to Omron or Gersung microswitches for an enjoyable play experience! The Honeywell microswitches for example are an incredibly cheap feeling switch that often breaks easily.</p> <p>With this in mind, the most common switch and spring setups are 50g/20g, 50g/60g, and 50g/100g setups  (microswitch listed first, then springs in this case). However, you will find arcades around the world using a myriad of setups.</p> <p>By default for a new or inexperienced player, I would recommend a 50g/60g setup as it's a safe setup that won't require frequent maintenance, has a nice weighted feeling that will help build stamina, and isn't too light for charts with heavy amounts of jacks. That said, it ultimately comes down to user preference, with lighter setups running the risk of more maintenance, but being easier on one's hands especially for dense charts, and heavier setups being more sturdy, but easily tiring out one's hands, 100g/100g for example however, is too extreme for the grand majority of players and simply exhausting and painful to play on.</p> <p>One thing worth noting is many tournaments in Japan have utilized a 25g/60g setup as well, with the heavy springs being beneficial for jacks, just as one example.</p> <p>Your springs will also naturally lose resistance over time, so if you played at an arcade with a heavily worn setup I'm sure you'll find it feels very different to your brand new home setup even if you have the same weight ratings.</p> <p>Experimentation is strongly recommended regardless as you become a more developed and experienced player. If you love the game, don't be afraid of traveling to try out different setups or dropping some more cash on parts to experiment.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#sound-voltex","title":"Sound Voltex","text":""},{"location":"extras/ascs/#dj-dao-svse5","title":"DJ DAO SVSE5","text":"<p>The SVSE5 is a pretty straightforward controller without much to worry about, the sizing is very compact while retaining proper arcade spacing between the knobs and buttons at a very reasonable price, most of the gripes with this controller will come based on what parts are used.

One other noteworthy convenience is the detachable USB cable, making transportation and storage a little more enjoyable.</p> <p>One of aspects people comment on a fair bit is the metal casing, after years of Dao's tacky glossy acrylic designs a lot of buyers have welcomed this addition with open arms. Yuan's SDVX controller is as durable and sturdy as any other out there.</p> <p>Yuan's stock SDVX buttons suffer the same problems as Dao's and are especially prone to sticking and getting stuck under their holders.

I'll try to cover springs, microswitches, and encoders to the best of my ability.</p> <p>I've also documented many of the parts that I talk about and where to buy them here</p> <ul> <li> <p>Springs and Microswitches</p> <p>For springs and microswitches, most vendor options consist of 20g, 60g, and 100g springs. Alongside 25g, 50g, and 100g microswitches. Cabs around the world use a variety of setups but two of the most common setups are 20g springs with 100g microswitches, and 100g springs with 100g microswitches. Commonly referenced as 20g/100g and 100g/100g, though sometimes interchangably used as 100g/20g for example. (there's really no definitive order and people put the spring weight or switch weight first on a whim constantly.)</p> <p>There are also various manufacturers of these parts, arcades use Sanwa parts. Some Korean arcades use Gersung Samduck parts however, a good Korean-made alternative. There are also various Chinese parts of equally garbage quality. If you order a controller with the stock Chinese buttons, they are including the cheap Chinese springs. These are fine, it's only a spring after all! But for the microswitches, please never use Chinese microswitches, they are of garbage quality and make playing the game horrendously unfun, I am adamant you do not believe the lies of those who say otherwise. </p> <p>An incredibly light setup such as 20g/25g can result in an extremely dissatisfying feedback on button press, making it hard to get the feeling of actuation on button press. Not many people go for this setup.</p> <p>Lots of home users default to 50g/60g setups for their first time around, it's a nice balance until they become more comfortable with the game and begin to branch out a bit more and figure out their preferences.</p> <p>Furthermore, lots of Round1 arcade locations in the US use 20g spring 100g microswitch setups, so if you played at one of those, you probably felt this setting. Just keep in mind that as the springs/switches wear down the feeling will be a little different than a fresh set!</p> </li> <li> <p>Encoders</p> <p>As for the encoders, they're the things that turn with the knob internally, they dictate the feeling of the rotation. The default encoders on most of the Dao controllers is the Alps 801 set, the Chinese default ones. These are beyond unplayable, with a clicky angle-snapping experience over a smooth twist. The grand majority of players opt for copal encoders, which are both incredibly smooth and sensitive. However, they are prone to breaking within about a year of moderate player.</p> <p>The YuanCon controllers use encoders that many feel are superior to copals both in feeling and durability, so they're a very worthwhile option as well.</p> <p>Lastly, the arcade encoders are extremely durable, reliable, and stiffer to turn than the other options, they're also more expensive as well.</p> <p>I've documented many of the parts and where to buy them here</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#popn-music","title":"Pop'n Music","text":""},{"location":"extras/ascs/#dj-dao-pop-asc","title":"DJ DAO POP ASC","text":"<p>Gamo2's Pop'n offering is a controller that results in a project for a lot of players. While it is a playable experience, for many, it will be dissatisfying out of the box. However, with a bit of knowledge one can turn it into a fantastic controller.</p> <p>One of the biggest issues with Pop'n controllers are the buttons. The Chinese default buttons are simply unacceptable, these things stick like crazy and getting Samduck buttons, a Korean alternative, is considered almost mandatory for a lot of players. It is possible to sand down the stock Chinese Dao buttons or get lucky and only have a few with problems, but the odds are heavily stacked against the buyer's favor here. The primary problem here and why Sanwas are not offered are their extreme cost, at around $40 a button it's simply out of reach for many. At the very least, one nice addition is that by default the controller comes with Omron microswitches.</p> <p>Dao's controller design here also isn't the best, it's big and bulky which has its pros and cons depending on preferences, but unlike Gamo2's other options providing magnetic bottoms that are easy to remove, the Pop'n ASC has 20 screws to gain access to the internals. While buyers hopefully won't need to be digging inside all that often, it's still a tedious process.</p> <p>This controller is notably loud too, any form of play is going to generate substantial noise that will annoy others in your household. Pop'n is naturally a loud game, but many attempts can be made to alleviate some of the noise. Some people play with a towel over the controller which is called toweling, but in the more desperate cases some people have filled the internals to brim with cotton balls and other various materials.</p> <p>Many users choose to upgrade from the default USB board to a custom one (Arduino, Arcin) since the button lights can't be controlled via software and it's only polling at the default 250hz. Of course that also means you can't use the original board's PS2 connector anymore.</p> <p>The pricing on this controller is a bit rough for many, due to the size and weight the shipping charges can be a significant problem notably more than other game's options as well, at least US buyers benefit from free shipping when it's in stock at the US storehouse.

It's also in a metal shell for added durability yet it has notably less weight than the Dao.</p> <p>One big positive for many is the detachable USB cable, it uses just one USB port which is quite handy. This comes at some costs though. The biggest issue is the lack of PS2 support, the lights are also dimmer than Dao's offerings which utilize 2 USB ports. Like it's competitor, it also doesn't seem to support HID-controlled button lights currently.</p> <p>One of the biggest issues with Pop'n controllers are the buttons. Yuan's stock Chinese buttons are notably better than Dao's, but Samduck buttons, a Korean alternative, are still preferred as the stock Chinese buttons don't always feel satisfying depending on preferences. Sanwa buttons are incredibly expensive at around $40 a pop for Pop'n controllers, so they're simply out of the question for many players.</p> <p>It's also worth noting that this controller comes with Chinese microswitches, which is a disappointment.

I'm omitting things like 400g springs, or 10g microswitches because no one really uses these products for regular play, but they exist nonetheless!</p> <p>One last thing, if there's for example, multiple model numbers of say, 25g microswitches, you can assume they have different internals and thus provide different feedback. I'm not aware of anyone qualified and experienced enough to give exact logistics on how these parts may feel different, so I've omitted any details and will simply specify what the most common vendors provide alongside these variants.</p> <p>7/26/2020 IMPORTANT Notice:</p> <p>Rakuten has switched to separate services, namely Rakuten Ichiba and Rakuten Global Express, they have provided an FAQ here. Essentially, some vendors will continue to offer international shipping, but the proxy service now exists for those that do not. If Sanwa Denshi does not ship to your region, simply sign up for their proxy service, or another of your choosing that is willing to provide for you.</p> <p>Alongside this, Sanwa Denshi seemingly no longer provides the typical lamps in many of the old-model button types that has been custom for many years. Given I am unfamiliar with anyone currently using these new lamps in their controllers, at the time of writing, I will provide links to buttons with the lamp and lamp-less buttons. On some listings, they allow the option to select the LED voltage and on others, they do not.</p> <ul> <li>Just for reference:<ul> <li>DJ DAO boards: 5V</li> <li>YuanCon boards: 12V</li> <li>Arcin: 5V (or 12V if you only hook up the negative side)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>So, if you're overly concerned as a new buyer, you can choose to buy lamps at a later date. I apologize for the inconvenience and current inability to provide more detailed information, and will be working to update this ASAP.</p> <p>Lastly, I have to remove IST Mall (Korean seller) from many of the listings at this time because their Sanwa options seemingly have now begun to use the new-style connectors that are not compatible with provided connectors from existing ASC vendors. I apologize for this inconvenience, but feel free to buy this new style if you understand JST connectors and can wire things up with basic electronics skills.</p>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#iidx-buttons","title":"IIDX Buttons","text":""},{"location":"extras/parts/#sanwa","title":"Sanwa","text":"<p>Rectangular Gameplay Keys</p> <ul> <li>Both OBSA-45UK-W and OBSA-45UK-B come with 100N springs and 100g switches (Omron V-10-1A4).</li> <li>OBSA-45UK-W (White keys)<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - With Lamp</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - Lamp-less</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder With Lamp</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder Lamp-less</li> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>OBSA-45UK-B (Black keys)<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - With Lamp</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - Lamp-less</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder With Lamp</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder Lamp-less</li> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Square Menu/Option Buttons</p> <ul> <li>OBSA-30UK<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - With Lamp)</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - Lamp-less)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#samduck","title":"Samduck","text":"<p>Rectangular Gameplay Keys</p> <ul> <li>CWB 405<ul> <li>Comes with Gersung switches (45g) and springs (20-30N)</li> <li>Does not come with lights but compatible with Dao lamps and ISTMall lamps.</li> <li>Can use the same switches and springs as Sanwa OBSA-45UK buttons.</li> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Square Menu/Option Buttons</p> <ul> <li>CWB 406<ul> <li>Does not come with lights but compatible with Dao lamps and ISTMall lamps.</li> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#sdvx-buttons","title":"SDVX Buttons","text":""},{"location":"extras/parts/#sanwa_1","title":"Sanwa","text":"<p>Square BT Gameplay Buttons</p> <ul> <li>Sanwa OBSA-60UK<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store)</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder With Lamp</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder Without Lamp</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Rectangular FX Gameplay Buttons</p> <ul> <li>OBSA-45UK-B (Black FX keys)<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - With Lamp)</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - Lamp-less)</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder With Lamp</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder Lamp-less</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Start Button</p> <ul> <li>OBSA-30UK<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - With Lamp)</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store - Lamp-less)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#samduck_1","title":"Samduck","text":"<p>Rectangular FX Gameplay Buttons</p> <ul> <li>CWB 405<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Start Button</p> <ul> <li>CWB 406<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>IST MALL (KR Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#sdvx-encoders","title":"SDVX Encoders","text":""},{"location":"extras/parts/#options","title":"Options","text":"<p>Copal Encoders</p> <ul> <li>RES20D-50-201-1<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Octopart (Lists Multiple Sellers)</li> <li>GAMO2 (Upgrade set from stock Chinese, CN seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>YuanCon's Encoders</p> <ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Tabobao (CN Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Sensatec Encoders (Arcade)</p> <ul> <li>ELV-24Y36A-K (GAMO2 Arcade Encoders)<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sensatec (JP Seller)</li> <li>Metro Electric (JP Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>ELV-24M36A-K<ul> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sensatec (JP Seller)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#popn-buttons","title":"Pop'n Buttons","text":""},{"location":"extras/parts/#sanwa_2","title":"Sanwa","text":"<p>Circular Dome Gameplay Buttons</p> <ul> <li>OBSA-100UMQ<ul> <li>Comes with 200N springs and 200g Omron switches.</li> <li>Where to buy:<ul> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - With Lamp</li> <li>Sanwa Rakuten (Official JP Store) - Lamp-less</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder With Lamp</li> <li>Buyee (Rakuten Proxy) - Old Lamp Holder Lamp-less</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/parts/#samduck_2","title":"Samduck","text":"<p>Circular Dome Gameplay Buttons</p> <ul> <li>CWB 401<ul> <li>IST Mall incorrectly claims to ship these with 40N springs and 45g Gersung switches, but in reality the springs are much, much heavier (suspected to be 200-300N springs).

Please note that a polling rate is NOT THE REFRESH RATE of a monitor, but is the critical factor in determining how responsive a touchscreen is and is unfortunately something every major retailer omits from their product listings due to lack of consumer awareness.</p> <p>At higher levels of gameplay, rapid button presses may fail to be acknowledged by touchscreen monitors with a low polling rate, making good scores impossible and creating a frustrating experience.</p> <p>Every BEMANI game with a touchscreen polls at 250hz, and some use an IR grid to achieve this. Thus, I am defining viable as 180hz or more, but I will include some monitors and manufacturer dates under this to help curious buyers be aware, as sometimes different manufacturer dates result in different polling rates and it's always good to document cruddy monitors to save people money.</p> <p>One thing to note is, this is not to say that monitors with low polling rates are unusable, they can still provide enjoyment and are often cheap enough to be a great option to see how far one may want to get into a certain touchscreen based game. But, the goal is to provide a potential buyer information to make an educated choice, and monitors with low polling rates will run the risk of needing to be replaced as higher levels of play, potentially causing frustration and wasted money.</p> <p>If you want to check your touch screen monitor's polling rate simply download Mouse Rate Checker and move your finger across the window at a reasonable pace, but not too fast!</p>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-s2240t","title":"Dell S2240T","text":"<ul> <li>2013 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>200hz GREAT!</li> </ul> </li> <li>2014 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>May: 200hz GREAT!</li> <li>September: 180hz</li> </ul> </li> <li>2015 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>March: 200hz GREAT!</li> <li>September: 200hz GREAT!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Late 2016 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>140hz AVOID</li> </ul> </li> <li>Early 2017 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mid 2017 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>140hz AVOID</li> </ul> </li> <li>February 2018 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-p2314t","title":"Dell P2314T","text":"<ul> <li>November 2015 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>60hz DO NOT BUY!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-p2418ht","title":"Dell P2418HT","text":"<ul> <li>May 2018 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>60hz DO NOT BUY!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#iiyama-t2336msc","title":"Iiyama T2336MSC","text":"<ul> <li>Revision B1:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/streamaudio/","title":"Workarounds for exclusive audio","text":"<p>Before reading:</p> <p>This section describes various workarounds and tips for dealing with games that use exclusive mode audio.</p> <p>In the recent years, BEMANI games started using WASAPI exclusive mode and ASIO to output game audio.

Simply install the pack and then run DDR A.</p> <p>To register the DLLs with Windows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open an elevated command prompt (Right click Command Prompt -&gt; Run As Administrator)</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to your Windows directory (Typically C:/ Windows), then to SysWOW64 (Or System32 if on a 32-bit version of Windows) by typing <code>cd C:/windows</code> inside the command prompt</p> </li> <li> <p>Type <code>regsvr32 [path to one of the two DLLs in your DDR A's \"content/com/\" folder]</code></p> <p>Ex: <code>regsvsr32 D:\\MDX-2019042200\\contents\\com k-clvsd.dll</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the command for the other DLL in the folder, and then close command prompt</p> <p>Ex: <code>regvsr32 D:\\MDX-2019042200\\contents\\com xactengine2_10.dll</code></p> </li> <li> <p>If everything went smoothly, run the game again with your desired tools and enjoy a properly working DDR A!</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"games/ddrace/problems/#i-want-to-play-in-43-sd-mode","title":"I Want to Play in 4:3 (SD) Mode!","text":"<p>If you're using SpiceTools, you can add <code>-ddrsd</code> to your <code>gamestart.bat</code> file and the game will boot into 4:3 mode.</p>"},{"location":"games/ddrace/problems/#where-is-the-option-for-dancersshadingmeasure-linesfast-slowlayering","title":"Where Is the Option For Dancers/Shading/Measure lines/Fast-Slow/Layering?","text":"<p>These options are locked behind network requirements and they will not show unless connected to a network that has written support for these options.
